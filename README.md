# Power_Soccer
The purpose of this power wheelchair soccer game is to give individuals with disabilities exposure to the game, learn the basics of the game, and hopefully encourage them to play the game in a physical, non-online environment. The open source game here will hopefully be fun for other users as well since the game is both similar to soccer and hockey except for a few rules outlined at the link below. This open source game will be shared widely among those with and without disabilities and among the over 60 teams playing the game on basketball courts across the country. You can see videos of some of the championship games at the 2nd link below.

The game of power wheelchair soccer is played on a basketball court 4 on 4. Each team has a goalie, 2 wings and a center or midfielder. Players can hit the ball using sidekicks or can drive straight into the ball or with the back of the chair. 2 penalties that you will want to learn about our referred to as 2 on 1 and 3 in the box. A 2 on 1 penalty refers to 2 offensive players both being within 10 feet of the ball while a defensive player is also attacking for the ball (this can also be 2 defensive players and 1 offensive player).  3 in the box refers to having more than the goalie plus one defensive player within the goalie box. This will result in a penalty and a free kick for the opposing team.
 
Our hope is to make this an online game where a player can either play against the computer and operate all the players on one team or be able to sign in and play other individuals. A downloadable program would also be of interest.
